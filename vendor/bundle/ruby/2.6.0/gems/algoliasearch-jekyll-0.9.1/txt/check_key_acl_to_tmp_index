Algolia Error: API key cannot write to `{index_name}_tmp` index
  In order to do atomic pushes to your Algolia index, the plugin first pushes to
  a temporary index (suffixed with `_tmp`), then renames it.

  You see this error because the plugin wasn't able to push to that 
  `{index_name}_tmp` index, with the API key you provided.

  Make sure the API key you're using has rights to write on both your index and
  its `{index_name}_tmp` suffixed version.
