It's with great pride that I share with you a selection of our Ladies in their Custom Orders.  

Whether it's Plus or Petite, Your Imagination for something different that fashion doesn't offer, frustration in not finding the right garment or just wanting a favourite piece replicated.  

We are the ladies for you.  

We are completely approachable and very honest. I'd much rather talk with you about your ideas.  

The creative process is a personal one.
