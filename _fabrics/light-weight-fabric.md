Light weight natural fabrics are perfect for our hot summers.

You'll find in my collection of fabrics a combination of 100% linens, cotton silk blends & cotton voiles.

Light weight fabrics make up beautifully in Tops, Shirts, Cami's and Flowing Jackets.

Not suitable for pants or skirts.

Please call Sue or Carole for advise on the right fabric for your garment.
