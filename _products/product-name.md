Kate Top.

Great top to accentuate your waist, while still being a relaxed fit.

Whilst suiting most body shapes. The feminine half circle frills slims down a hippy figure.&nbsp;

Gentle frill on the sleeve provides good arm/underarm coverage whilst having plenty of room if you have a larger upper arm.

If you have a tummy this top is also suited to you, as it disguise's it beautifully with the gentle frill. The back is slightly longer which as we know gives a sliming side on veiw.&nbsp;

Wonderful plus size top.
