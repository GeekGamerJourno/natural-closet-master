**BoHo Top.**

Well\! &nbsp;the name says it all BoHo top.

This top will always be a one off top.

Its about finding the right fabric's that go together. So ask if you love it and I can surprise you with you very own creation.

Description is self evident. BoHo is a loose cool tunic great for those of us with bigger biceps and tummy's that need to hidden stylishly.

I've made it into a dress and that looks really good.

For bottoms I'd go a close fitting pant like our Foil 7/8 cotton spandex pant.Or a tight knit to the knee straight skirt.

&nbsp;

**Please Note:**

BoHo top is a one off so you need to call me and I can put something together for you.&nbsp;
